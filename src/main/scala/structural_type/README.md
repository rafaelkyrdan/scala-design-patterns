# Structural type(Duck typing).

It is a structural pattern. This pattern comes from dynamic languages.
Pattern requires that type checking is deferred to runtime. It is concerned
with determining the suitability of an object for some purpose. With normal typing, 
suitability is assumed to be determined by an object's type only. 
In `duck typing`, an object's suitability is determined by the presence of 
certain methods and properties(and their signature), rather than 
the actual type of the object. Scala allows implement this pattern in a 
perfectly type safe way using structural types. Follow the comments in the examples.
